            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>As you probably guessed from the title, my name is Tyler Wharmby. I'm a born Canadian, born on January 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2003 and I was raised in the town of Bowmanville, Ontario. From a young age I was always into technology and any aspects that revolved around design. I took up hobbies such as, writing, drawing, and computer science. In highschool I realized it was possible to put my passion for technolgy and design together in classes such as, programming, animation, and photoshop.</p>

            <p>I’m currently a student at the Algonquin college located in Ottawa, Ontario and my current program of study is <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> Since a young age, I’ve always had a strong love for technology and any aspect of design. Even as a kid, manipulating technology to my advantage used to be a great way to spend my time, especially if I could get paid. I realized while back in my highschool programming course that it was a great path to head down. Ever since then I have wanted to become a web developer, where I can use my passion as an occupation.</p>
