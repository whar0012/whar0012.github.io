                <p>As you probably guessed from the title, my name is Tyler Wharmby. I'm a born Canadian, born on January 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2003 and I was raised in the town of Bowmanville, Ontario. From a young age, I was always into technology and any aspects that revolved around design. I took up hobbies such as writing, drawing, and computer science. In high school, I realized it was possible to put my passion for technology and design together in classes such as programming, animation, and photoshop.</p>

                <p>I’m currently a student at the Algonquin college located in Ottawa, Ontario and my current program of study is <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> Since a young age, I’ve always had a strong love for technology and any aspect of design. Even as a kid, manipulating technology to my advantage was a great way to spend my time, especially if I could get paid. I realized while back in my high school programming course that it was a great path to head down. Since then I have wanted to become a web developer, where I can use my passion as an occupation.</p>
